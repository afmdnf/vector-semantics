# NLP - Vector Semantics

The IPython notebook walks through the implementation of TF-IDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) in order to produce vector representations of words and see how they capture information about their context. This allows us to find the closest words for a given input word (here, closeness is defined as the words that are most likely to appear in the context of the input word).
